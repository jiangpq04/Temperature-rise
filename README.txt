"Temperature-rise"
This MATLAB code calculates steady-state temperature rise in a 3D anisotropic layered system upon laser heating (in TDTR/FDTR experiments) and metal strip joule heating (in 3-omega experiments). 
Details of the model can be referred to the paper: "Temperature Rise in 3D Anisotropic Layered Structures in Thermoreflectance and 3 Experiments" (arXiv preprint arXiv:1912.01534)
